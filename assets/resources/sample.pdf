Beginner Calculus Notes

1. Limits
- Definition: The limit of f(x) as x approaches a is L if f(x) gets arbitrarily close to L when x is close to a.
- Notation: lim_{x->a} f(x) = L
- Example techniques: direct substitution, factor & cancel, rationalize, squeeze theorem.

2. Derivatives (Intro)
- Definition: The derivative f'(x) is the instantaneous rate of change: f'(x)=lim_{h->0} (f(x+h)-f(x))/h
- Basic rules: power rule, constant rule, sum rule, product rule, quotient rule, chain rule.

3. Integrals (Intro)
- Indefinite integral: ∫ f(x) dx = F(x) + C where F'(x)=f(x)
- Definite integral: area under curve from a to b: ∫_a^b f(x) dx
- Fundamental Theorem of Calculus links derivatives and integrals.

4. Common Functions
- Power functions: x^n
- Exponential: e^x
- Logarithmic: ln(x)
- Trigonometric: sin(x), cos(x), tan(x)

5. Quick tips
- Practice limits first — many derivative/integral problems build on limit manipulation.
- Keep derivative rules handy; memorize the derivatives of basic trig, exp, and log functions.
